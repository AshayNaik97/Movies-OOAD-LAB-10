Problem Statement 
Design a simple movie database website allows users to browse and rate movies (think an

application into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. Use any Java
framework of your choice, including but not limited to :
− Spring
− Grails
− Vaadin
− Play
− Struts
− Java Server Faces
Make sure your project directory contains the Model, View and Controller subdirectories. In
case of some frameworks like Spring, you’ll also have to include an extra Service class that
handles business logic.
